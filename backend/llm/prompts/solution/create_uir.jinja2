You are a requirements analyst tasked with extracting User Interface Requirements from the provided app description. Below is the description of the app:

App Name: {{name}}
App Description: {{description}}

{% include 'uir.jinja2' %}

Output Structure should be a valid JSON: Here is the sample Structure:

{
  "uir": [
    {
      "id": "UIR1", "title": <title> ,"requirement": "[User Interface Requirements]"
    },
    {
      "id": "UIR2", "title": <title> ,"requirement": "[User Interface Requirements]"
    }...
  ]
}

Please ensure the requirements are clear, concise, and comprehensive. Output only valid JSON. Do not include ```json ``` on start and end of the response.
Generate User Interface Requirements targeting the preferred range {{ generation_count_range[0] }} to {{ generation_count_range[1] }}. If generating requirements outside this range would provide significant business value (either more or fewer requirements), Sort all requirements based on business impact (High to Medium to Low).
