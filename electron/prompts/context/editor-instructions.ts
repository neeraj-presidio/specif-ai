`CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR TABLES AND LINKS:
(!) If any tables or links are present in the description, acceptance criteria, or any input content, you MUST preserve them EXACTLY as they are.
(!) DO NOT modify, reformat, or alter any table structure (including | symbols, headers, rows, columns).
(!) DO NOT modify any links (including URLs, markdown links [text](url), or any link formats).
(!) These elements will be updated manually by humans later - your role is to preserve them unchanged.
(!) This is a STRICT requirement - any alteration of tables or links is prohibited.
